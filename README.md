# Twinvest

## Introduction

The project harnesses blockchain and DeFi to deliver a secure and transparent solution for invoice financing, empowering businesses and freelancers with improved cash flow.The invoice financing system enables Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to tokenize unpaid invoices as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), allowing investors to purchase them for an early capital, with automated repayment via smart contracts.

## Description

A decentralized app that helps freelancers receive Bitcoin salaries by issuing invoice NFTs, which can optionally be financed by investors before being paid by clients. The entire process is transparent, verifiable, and runs fully on the Internet Computer (ICP).

### How it works - role to role

#### 👨‍💻 Freelancers

Create Profile: Sign in with Internet Identity. Set up their Bitcoin address, skills, and past experience.

Issue Invoice: After completing work, the freelancer creates an invoice. This invoice is minted as an NFT on ICP, containing:

1. Amount due

2. Due date

3. Work description

4. Client reference

5. Get Paid in Bitcoin: If not financed, the freelancer waits for the client to pay directly to their BTC wallet when the invoice is due.

#### 🧑‍💼 Clients

1. Hire & Approve Work: After a job is done, they approve the invoice submitted by the freelancer.

2. Pay Invoice: Send the payment in Bitcoin to the address on the invoice NFT (can be the freelancer or the investor if the invoice was financed).

3. On-Chain Proof: The app verifies the payment was made on-chain (via BTC integration on ICP using Chain Fusion), updates the invoice status to "Paid."

#### 💸 Investors

1. Browse Invoices: See open, unfinanced invoices from verified freelancers/clients.

2. Buy at Discount: Choose an invoice and purchase it. (We will try to implement this)

3. Wait for Payment: When the client pays the full amount, the payment goes to the investor's BTC wallet — they earn a return.

4. On-Chain History: Each invoice NFT tracks ownership, financing, repayment, and rating info, building investor trust scores.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- A computer with a bash terminal
- Access to the Internet

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) (for Internet Computer development)
- A supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Git

You can install DFX using the following:

- Run this command on terminal

```bash
 sh-ci "$(curl-fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify:

```bash
dfx --version

```

## Installations

1. Clone the project and navigate into the directory:

```bash
https://github.com/toonshi/twinvest

```

2. cd twinvest

```bash
cd twinvest

```

3. Install front-end dependancies

```bash
npm install

```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

React – Used for building the responsive and interactive front-end user interface.

Motoko – A modern, actor-based programming language used to develop the backend canisters running on the Internet Computer (ICP).

## Support and Contact Details

Incase of any query, need for collaboration or issues with this code, feel free to reach me at:
fabbydebby@gmail.com

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd twinvest/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
